            <br>
            <p>My research has won numerous prestigious international awards, including the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) awards. <a href="https://cis.ieee.org/awards/past-recipients#TFSOutstandingPaperAward">I received the 2010 Outstanding Paper Award in the IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems and the 2004 Outstanding Paper Award in the same journal.</a> Additionally, I was awarded the <a href="https://www1.essex.ac.uk/news/event.aspx?e_id=7695">2015 and 2017 Global Telecommunications Business awards for joint projects with British Telecom</a>. In 2016, I was elected as a Distinguished Lecturer by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. In 2022, I was awarded the Outstanding Associate Editor Commendation from the IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems. My work has also won best paper awards at several leading international conferences, including the 2014 and 2006 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, the 2012 UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence, and the 2016 BCS/SGAI International Conference on Artificial Intelligence. I was awarded the <a href="https://cis.ieee.org/awards/past-recipients#OutstandingChapterAward">2011 IEEE CIS Outstanding Chapter Award</a>. In 2021, I received <a href="https://vimeo.com/631827697">the Best Knowledge Transfer Partnership award</a> from the University of Essex. In 2018, I was awarded the <a href="https://vimeo.com/303229891">best Knowledge Transfer Partnership Academic</a> by the University of Essex, and in 2017, I received the best Research Impact award for my work with British Telecom. I served as the Principal Investigator for a project that received the 2011 UK Best Knowledge Transfer Partnership for London and the East Region from the UK Technology Strategy Board and another project awarded the 2009 Lord Stafford Achievement in Innovation Award for East of England. In 2010, I led a research students team to win first place in the RoboCup 2010. In 2007, I was shortlisted by the Times Higher Education Supplement (THES) for the UK Young Researcher of the Year award.</p>
            <br>

            <li>Awarded in cooperation with British Telecom (BT) the 2015 Global Telecoms Business Innovation Awards under the Business Service Innovation Category. The award was for the project entitled “Work Area Optimization for Telecoms Engineers” (iPatctch). iPatch helped BT achieve its best public switched telephone network performance due to increasing the amount of work completed by engineers (productivity increase of 7%) by optimising the geographical areas to reduce the amount of time engineers spend travelling (travel was reduced by 3%). Furthermore, the iPatch reduced fuel costs and CO2 emissions significantly (reduction of 2,500 metric tonnes of CO2 annually). The work formed the basis of an <a href="https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/b5e1ee0c-6387-46f3-9f93-00fc5bf5556c?page=1"> case study submitted to Ref 2021.</a></li>

    <h1>Impact</h1>
<p>Due to the industrial and application relevance of my research, I have been involved in strong collaboration with industry. This industrial collaboration was in form of collaborative research projects, knowledge transfer and consultancies. This industrial collaboration is of great benefit as besides providing research funding, it also allows the development of courses that are of direct relevance to industry as well as providing industrial placements which will further enhance the skills of the University graduates. Furthermore, this industrial cooperation allows the dissemination of my research into real world products and services which can be useful and helpful to the community.
